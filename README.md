A FHIR Store with internal, fast CQL Evaluation Engine

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a FHIR Store with an internal CQL Evaluation Engine which is able to answer population wide aggregate queries in a timely manner to enable interactive, online queries.

## State

The project is currently under active development. Essentially all official [CQL Tests][3] pass. Please report any issues you encounter during evaluation.

## Usage

You need Docker to run the LIFE FHIR Store. The most convenient way is to check out this repository and use the `docker-compose.yml` to bring the LIFE FHIR Store up. The default memory requirements are 4 GB. You also need to have port 8080 free on your host.

To start the LIFE FHIR Store, type:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see a output similar to:

```

```

In order to test connectivity, you can query the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

It should return `OK`.

### Upload FHIR Resources

Before you can issue CQL queries against the LIFE FHIR Store, you have to upload some FHIR resources. If you have none, you can generate them y using the [FHIR Test Data Generator][1].

```bash
life-fhir-gen -n1 > bundle.json
```

Next you need to upload that `bundle.json` to the LIFE FHIR Store:

```bash
curl -d @bundle.json http://localhost:8080/fhir
```

The result should be:

```
{"message":"OK","t":<some number>}
```

If you like to upload your own resources, it's important, that the LIFE FHIR Store is currently configured to use a subset of FHIR R4. The available Resources can be seen at startup in the `Read structure definitions` output.

### Issuing a CQL Query

The most convenient way is to use the [CQL Runner][2]. You have to go into the `Config` menu and set the `CQL Engine` to `http://localhost:8080/cql/evaluate`. The other config options doesn't matter because the CQL Engine of the LIFE FHIR Store always uses its own internal data.

### Deleting the Data Volume

If you like to restart with a fresh database, you have to delete the data volume. You can do this by typing:

```bash
docker volume rm life-fhir-store_db-data
```
